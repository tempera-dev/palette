//! Optional thin "ingest" role binary (R1.2).
//!
//! Palette ships as a single all-in-one `paletted` by default. The future service
//! split is *logical, not operational*: this thin bin exists only behind the
//! `thin-bins` cargo feature so an operator who wants to scale the ingest path
//! independently can, but nobody is forced into a multi-service deployment.
//!
//! It is intentionally a stub: it documents the role and points back at the
//! all-in-one binary rather than duplicating the wiring, so the supported path
//! stays the one tested by `bins/paletted/tests/*`.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p paletted --features thin-bins --bin palette-ingestd
//! ```
