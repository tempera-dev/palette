//! OpenAPI 3.1 contract for the Beater API.
//!
//! This is the single source of truth for the multi-language SDK pipeline. Every
//! route registered in [`crate::router`] is documented here via `#[utoipa::path]`
//! annotations placed on the real handler functions in `lib.rs`, and every schema
//! is derived from the real request/response types (no hand-maintained mirrors).
