## Commands

```bash
bash -o pipefail -lc 'sha_line="$(git ls-remote --exit-code https://github.com/jadenfix/beater.git refs/heads/main)" && sha="${sha_line%%[[:space:]]*}" && test -n "$sha" && preflight="$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/beater-gate2-preflight.XXXXXX")" && curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadenfix/beater/$sha/scripts/gate2-outside-local-preflight.sh" -o "$preflight" && bash "$preflight" && t="$(date +%s)" && git clone https://github.com/jadenfix/beater.git && cd beater && test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$sha" && BEATER_GATE2_CLONE_STARTED_EPOCH="$t" scripts/gate2-outside-run.sh'
```

No project maintainer may provide step-by-step help beyond public repo docs
during the timed run.
Run the command from a directory that does not already contain `beater/`; reruns
must start from a new or empty parent directory. If an aborted previous attempt
left default ports occupied by `beater-stopwatch`, use the cleanup hint printed
by the preflight before rerunning.

The wrapper sets the required proof/browser/recording flags and rejects
non-`main` checkouts, non-canonical GitHub origins, dirty worktrees, warm-loop reuse,
local source builds, alternate ports, mutable pull-policy overrides,
prebuilt image overrides, evidence artifact path overrides, Compose file/profile/project
overrides, and teardown overrides before the stopwatch starts. It also requires
`BEATER_GATE2_CLONE_STARTED_EPOCH` from before `git clone`, so
`Time-to-first-trace` and `Time-to-quickstart-click` include clone time. The
stopwatch proof records
`Outside-run wrapper: yes`, `Git branch: main`, the Git origin, and
`Git worktree clean: yes`; completed outside-person evidence is invalid without
those markers. The stopwatch proof must also identify itself as an
outside-run stopwatch source artifact, not an automated local stopwatch proof.

The command runs `scripts/gate2-outside-local-preflight.sh` from the public repo
before the stopwatch starts, so missing local tooling, remote Docker contexts,
and occupied default ports fail before the timed attempt. The cloned wrapper
then repeats the same checks. The script fails before Compose startup if local Docker is unavailable, if curl
or `ffprobe` is missing, if recording SHA tooling is missing, or if API `8080`,
OTLP `4317`, or dashboard `3000` are still in use after it removes any previous
Beater stopwatch project. It also requires `python3` before the timed run so
proof generation and validation cannot fail late on missing local tooling;
Python 3.9 or newer is required. The stock
OpenTelemetry Python snippet runs in the prebuilt `otel-python` container, and
browser proof runs in the prebuilt `dashboard-e2e` container. Remote
`DOCKER_HOST` values and remote Docker contexts are rejected because the browser
proof connects to `127.0.0.1`. For
this outside-person proof, free those default ports instead of using alternate
port environment variables. If preflight reports another process on a default
port, stop that app and rerun. Do not set `COMPOSE_FILE`, `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`,
or `COMPOSE_PROFILES`; the public command controls the Compose topology.

As soon as the first `Open this quickstart trace-list URL first:` URL appears,
the runner must open that filtered trace-list URL in a normal browser; do not
wait for the script to finish. The manual checkpoint prints the seconds
remaining in the 5-minute clone-to-click SLO, which already includes clone and
image-pull time. Click the quickstart trace, click the `llm.call` span, and
capture prompt, completion, model, token breakdown, cost, latency, and the
`Confirm` code shown in the selected detail. Type that confirmation code in the
terminal and press Enter only after the manual click-through is complete; this
records `Quickstart click source: manual-outside-runner`,
`Manual quickstart confirmation: yes`,
`Manual confirmation source: browser-selected-llm-detail`,
`Manual confirmation code: <code>`, the per-run manual confirmation salt, and
the 5-minute quickstart-click SLO.
Then keep the script running for the post-SLO automated browser proof, all-kind
trace, and recording evidence, open the all-kind dashboard URL, and capture the
run -> turn -> step -> tool -> MCP waterfall. The same post-SLO proof seeds a
sensitive native `llm.call` trace, verifies prompt/completion are redacted by
default, submits the required unmask reason, verifies unmasked I/O, and returns
to Redacted view. Cleanup can happen after the recording.

After the stopwatch command finishes, use the prefilled
`scripts/generate-gate2-outside-proof.py --print-command` output printed in the
terminal. It copies the stopwatch-derived dashboard URLs, terminal excerpt, and
compose-log artifact into a ready-to-edit command. Replace every `...` field
with the runner's actual values before running it; the generator and validator
reject unresolved evidence. `--prior-exposure "none"` is valid when the runner
has never seen the repository before, and the proof date defaults to the UTC
date captured in the stopwatch proof's `Clone started at` field. Save the
outside-run terminal transcript or compose logs as a repo-relative,
committed/clean, non-symlink file under `docs/demos/` (for example
`docs/demos/gate2-outside-compose.log`), or use an immutable GitHub Actions
run/job URL such as `https://github.com/jadenfix/beater/actions/runs/<run_id>`.
The outside-run wrapper writes `docs/demos/gate2-outside-compose.log`
automatically and pre-fills that path with `--compose-logs-saved`.

If you need to reprint the command, run:

```bash
scripts/generate-gate2-outside-proof.py --print-command
```

The fully expanded form looks like this:

```bash
quickstart_dashboard="$(sed -n 's/^- Quickstart dashboard: //p' docs/demos/gate2-compose-stopwatch.md)"
all_kind_dashboard="$(sed -n 's/^- All-kind dashboard: //p' docs/demos/gate2-compose-stopwatch.md)"
redaction_dashboard="$(sed -n 's/^- Redaction dashboard: //p' docs/demos/gate2-compose-stopwatch.md)"

  --compose-logs-saved "docs/demos/gate2-outside-compose.log" \
  --preflight-status "passed" \
  --attest-outside-run
```

After replacing this template with completed evidence, run:

```bash
git add docs/demos/gate2-outside-person-proof.md \
  docs/demos/gate2-compose-stopwatch.md \
  docs/demos/gate2-compose-browser-demo.webm \
  docs/demos/gate2-compose-browser-demo.md \
  docs/demos/gate2-outside-compose.log
git commit -m "add gate2 outside proof"
scripts/validate-gate2-outside-proof.sh
```

Maintainers should run this full public-clone verifier before handing the repo
to an outside runner, after the `container-images` workflow has published the
current commit:

```bash
scripts/check-gate2-public-handoff.py --full-run
```

That mode first preflights the local runtime: canonical public source URL only,
`docker`, Docker Compose v2, `curl`, `ffprobe`, local Docker daemon, SHA tooling,
and free default ports after removing any previous `beater-stopwatch` Compose project.
It then downloads the raw public preflight from the expected immutable commit
and runs it under `bash -o pipefail -lc` before any clone. Remote `DOCKER_HOST` values and
remote Docker contexts fail before clone or Compose cleanup. It runs
`scripts/check-gate2-outside-readiness.py`, uses one fresh clone from
`https://github.com/jadenfix/beater.git` for exact-commit, cloned readiness, and
wrapper dry-run checks, then uses a second fresh clone for the timed runtime
path. The readiness check verifies clean `main`, the expected
GitHub remote, this proof file's structure, and public multi-arch GHCR images
for the exact commit. The verifier executes the second clone's
`scripts/gate2-outside-run.sh` wrapper with the clone-start timestamp captured
immediately before that second `git clone`, waits until the wrapper prints the
manual quickstart checkpoint, uses a browser click to read and enter the confirmation
code from the selected `llm.call` detail for diagnostic automation only, and cleans up the `beater-stopwatch` Compose project after the
wrapper exits. It proves the exact public outside-run path and images can run,
but it is not outside-person evidence and does not close this proof file. Its
generated report is `Status: diagnostic.` and default outside-person validation
rejects it as closure evidence. `--full-run` is intentionally supported only
for the canonical public GitHub/GHCR handoff,
not fixture or fork URLs.

If Docker is unavailable on the maintainer machine, run
`scripts/check-gate2-public-handoff.py` without `--full-run`; that still
performs the public clone, exact-commit, wrapper dry-run, proof-structure, and
multi-arch GHCR-image checks, but it is not a runtime handoff proof.

The validator reads the listed stopwatch proof file, screen-recording notes, and
`ffprobe` playable-video metadata,
then cross-checks default API/OTLP/dashboard endpoints, clean-start status,
browser-proof status, trace IDs, dashboard URLs, per-run quickstart release ID,
the same quickstart release ID in the screen-recording notes,
redacted-I/O browser proof status, redaction trace ID, redaction span ID,
redaction dashboard URL, redaction unmask reason,
SHA-pinned prebuilt GHCR image references, structured compose service and
`proof-image` digest rows, prebuilt GHCR image digests bound to the public GHCR
manifest digest set for the exact SHA tag, stock quickstart snippet markers, and
the tested public GitHub origin, Date-to-clone-start consistency,
`main` branch, clean-worktree state, and commit SHA. If the proof commit is newer
than the tested SHA, every later committed change must be under `docs/demos/`;
uncommitted non-evidence worktree changes are rejected at closure. It verifies
the stopwatch proof identifies itself as an outside-run stopwatch source
artifact, recorded a manual outside-runner quickstart click confirmation before
the 5-minute SLO, verifies
screen-recording SHA256 against the committed artifact, requires the artifact to
be a playable WebM capture of at least 64 KiB and at least 8 seconds with
EBML/WebM, Segment, Info, Tracks, and Cluster structure plus a video track, and
requires the recording notes to declare `Recording mode: compose`, the matching
quickstart release ID, and describe
the full click-through: quickstart trace, `llm.call`, prompt, completion, model,
token breakdown, cost, latency, confirmation code, and run -> turn -> step ->
tool -> MCP waterfall, plus the sensitive `llm.call` redacted prompt/completion,
unmask reason, unmasked I/O, and Redacted view.
Stopwatch, recording, notes, and saved compose-log paths must be repo-relative
paths under `docs/demos/` and must not resolve through symlinks. Saved
compose-log evidence must be a committed/clean file at closure, or an immutable
GitHub Actions run/job URL under
`https://github.com/jadenfix/beater/actions/runs/`.
