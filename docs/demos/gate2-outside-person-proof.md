# Gate 2 Outside-Person Proof

Status: not yet completed.

Gate 2 is not passed until this file is replaced with evidence from a person
outside the project who runs the flow unaided from a fresh clone.

## Commands

```bash
BEATER_GATE2_CLONE_STARTED_EPOCH="$(date +%s)"
git clone https://github.com/jadenfix/beater.git
cd beater
BEATER_GATE2_CLONE_STARTED_EPOCH="$BEATER_GATE2_CLONE_STARTED_EPOCH" scripts/gate2-outside-run.sh
```

No project maintainer may provide step-by-step help beyond public repo docs
during the timed run.

The wrapper sets the required proof/browser/recording flags and rejects
non-`main` checkouts, non-canonical GitHub origins, dirty worktrees, warm-loop reuse,
local source builds, alternate ports, mutable pull-policy overrides,
prebuilt image overrides, evidence artifact path overrides, Compose project overrides,
and teardown overrides before the stopwatch starts. It also requires
`BEATER_GATE2_CLONE_STARTED_EPOCH` from before `git clone`, so
`Time-to-first-trace` and `Time-to-quickstart-click` include clone time. The
stopwatch proof records
`Outside-run wrapper: yes`, `Git branch: main`, the Git origin, and
`Git worktree clean: yes`; completed outside-person evidence is invalid without
those markers.

The script fails before Compose startup if Docker is unavailable, if curl is
missing, or if API `8080`, OTLP `4317`, or dashboard `3000` are still in use
after it removes any previous Beater stopwatch project. The stock OpenTelemetry
Python snippet runs in the prebuilt `otel-python` container, and browser proof
runs in the prebuilt `dashboard-e2e` container. For this outside-person proof,
free those default ports instead of using alternate port environment variables.

After the script prints the dashboard URLs, the runner must open
`http://127.0.0.1:3000` in a normal browser, click the quickstart trace, click
the `llm.call` span, and capture the evidence below. Cleanup can happen after
the recording.

After the stopwatch command finishes, prefer generating completed evidence from
the stopwatch proof instead of manually copying fields:

```bash
scripts/generate-gate2-outside-proof.py \
  --runner-name "..." \
  --relationship "..." \
  --prior-exposure "none" \
  --machine-os "..." \
  --browser "..." \
  --preflight-status "passed" \
  --attest-outside-run
```

After replacing this template with completed evidence, run:

```bash
scripts/validate-gate2-outside-proof.sh
```

Maintainers should run this public-clone verifier before handing the repo to an
outside runner, after the `container-images` workflow has published the current
commit:

```bash
scripts/check-gate2-public-handoff.py
```

The public handoff verifier first runs
`scripts/check-gate2-outside-readiness.py`, then performs a fresh clone from
`https://github.com/jadenfix/beater.git`, verifies the clone is on the exact
same commit, reruns the cloned readiness check, and dry-runs the cloned
`scripts/gate2-outside-run.sh` wrapper. The readiness check verifies clean
`main`, the expected GitHub remote, this proof file's structure, and public
multi-arch GHCR images for the exact commit.

For stronger maintainer preflight before handoff, run:

```bash
scripts/check-gate2-public-handoff.py --full-run
```

That mode executes the real prebuilt-image stopwatch path inside the public
clone with Compose cleanup enabled. It proves the public clone and images can
run, but it is not outside-person evidence and does not close this proof file.

The validator reads the listed stopwatch proof file and screen-recording notes,
then cross-checks default API/OTLP/dashboard endpoints, clean-start status,
browser-proof status, trace IDs, dashboard URLs, SHA-pinned prebuilt GHCR image
references, prebuilt GHCR image digests, and the tested public GitHub origin,
`main` branch, clean-worktree state, and commit SHA. If the proof commit is newer than the tested
SHA, every later change must be under `docs/demos/`. It verifies
screen-recording SHA256 against the committed artifact, requires the artifact to
be a WebM capture of at least 64 KiB with a WebM/EBML header, and requires the
recording notes to describe the full click-through: quickstart trace,
`llm.call`, prompt, completion, model, tokens, cost, latency, and run -> turn ->
step -> tool -> MCP waterfall. Stopwatch, recording, and notes paths must be
repo-relative paths under `docs/demos/`.

## Pass Checklist

- [ ] Fresh clone was used.
- [ ] Docker was running before the stopwatch started.
- [ ] curl was available before the stopwatch started.
- [ ] Default ports were used: API `127.0.0.1:8080`, OTLP `127.0.0.1:4317`,
      dashboard `127.0.0.1:3000`.
- [ ] `BEATER_GATE2_REUSE` was not set.
- [ ] The script reported `Clean start: yes`.
- [ ] Time-to-first-trace was 300 seconds or less.
- [ ] Time-to-first-trace includes clone time.
- [ ] Time-to-quickstart-click was 300 seconds or less.
- [ ] The five-line stock OpenTelemetry trace appeared in `localhost:3000`.
- [ ] Clicking the `llm.call` span showed prompt, completion, model, tokens,
      cost, and latency.
- [ ] The all-kind trace rendered run -> turn -> step -> tool -> MCP nesting in
      the waterfall.
- [ ] The browser proof passed for both the quickstart trace and all-kind
      waterfall.
- [ ] The stopwatch script generated and reported the browser recording.
- [ ] A screen recording of the full flow is committed under `docs/demos/`.
- [ ] The runner completed the flow using only public repository instructions.
