# Gate 2 Outside-Person Proof

Status: not yet completed.

Gate 2 is not passed until this file is replaced with evidence from a person
outside the project who runs the flow unaided from a fresh clone.

## Commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jadenfix/beater.git
cd beater
BEATER_GATE2_WRITE_PROOF=1 BEATER_GATE2_BROWSER_PROOF=1 BEATER_GATE2_RECORD_DEMO=1 scripts/gate2-compose-stopwatch.sh
```

No project maintainer may provide step-by-step help beyond public repo docs
during the timed run.

After the script prints the dashboard URLs, the runner must open
`http://127.0.0.1:3000` in a normal browser, click the quickstart trace, click
the `llm.call` span, and capture the evidence below. Cleanup can happen after
the recording.

## Required Evidence

- Stopwatch proof file:
- Screen recording: `docs/demos/gate2-compose-browser-demo.webm`
- Screen recording notes: `docs/demos/gate2-compose-browser-demo.md`
- Screen recording SHA256:
- Terminal output excerpt:
- `docker compose images` excerpt:
- Quickstart trace ID:
- Quickstart dashboard URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/...`
- All-kind nested trace ID:
- All-kind dashboard URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/...`
- `docker compose` logs saved:
- Failure notes, if any:

## Pass Checklist

      cost, and latency.
- [ ] The all-kind trace rendered run -> turn -> step -> tool -> MCP nesting in
      the waterfall.

ambiguity here. These notes are blocking feedback until fixed or explicitly
