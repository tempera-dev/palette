## Commands

```bash
bash -lc 't="$(date +%s)" && git clone https://github.com/jadenfix/beater.git && cd beater && BEATER_GATE2_CLONE_STARTED_EPOCH="$t" scripts/gate2-outside-run.sh'
```

No project maintainer may provide step-by-step help beyond public repo docs
during the timed run.
Run the command from a directory that does not already contain `beater/`; reruns
must start from a new or empty parent directory.

The wrapper sets the required proof/browser/recording flags and rejects
non-`main` checkouts, non-canonical GitHub origins, dirty worktrees, warm-loop reuse,
local source builds, alternate ports, mutable pull-policy overrides,
prebuilt image overrides, evidence artifact path overrides, Compose project overrides,
and teardown overrides before the stopwatch starts. It also requires
`BEATER_GATE2_CLONE_STARTED_EPOCH` from before `git clone`, so
`Time-to-first-trace` and `Time-to-quickstart-click` include clone time. The
stopwatch proof records
`Outside-run wrapper: yes`, `Git branch: main`, the Git origin, and
`Git worktree clean: yes`; completed outside-person evidence is invalid without
those markers.

The script fails before Compose startup if local Docker is unavailable, if curl
is missing, if recording SHA tooling is missing, or if API `8080`, OTLP `4317`,
or dashboard `3000` are still in use after it removes any previous Beater
stopwatch project. It also requires `python3` before the timed run so proof
generation and validation cannot fail late on missing local tooling; Python
3.9 or newer is required. The stock
OpenTelemetry Python snippet runs in the prebuilt `otel-python` container, and
browser proof runs in the prebuilt `dashboard-e2e` container. Remote
`DOCKER_HOST` values and remote Docker contexts are rejected because the browser
proof connects to `127.0.0.1`. For
this outside-person proof, free those default ports instead of using alternate
port environment variables.

After the script prints the dashboard URLs, the runner must open the
quickstart dashboard URL in a normal browser, click the quickstart trace, click
the `llm.call` span, and capture prompt, completion, model, tokens, cost, and
latency. Then the runner must open the all-kind dashboard URL and capture the
run -> turn -> step -> tool -> MCP waterfall. Cleanup can happen after the
recording.

After the stopwatch command finishes, prefer generating completed evidence from
the stopwatch proof instead of manually copying fields. Replace every identity
and environment example below with the runner's actual values. Do not leave
placeholder values such as `...`; the generator and validator reject unresolved
evidence.

```bash
scripts/generate-gate2-outside-proof.py \
  --runner-name "Jane Outside Runner" \
  --relationship "external evaluator; no Beater maintainer role" \
  --prior-exposure "none" \
  --machine-os "Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64" \
  --browser "Chrome stable" \
  --network-notes "home Wi-Fi; no VPN" \
  --llm-observation "clicked llm.call and saw prompt, completion, model, tokens, cost, and latency" \
  --waterfall-observation "opened all-kind trace and saw run -> turn -> step -> tool -> MCP nesting" \
  --preflight-status "passed" \
  --attest-outside-run
```

After replacing this template with completed evidence, run:

```bash
scripts/validate-gate2-outside-proof.sh
```

Maintainers should run this full public-clone verifier before handing the repo
to an outside runner, after the `container-images` workflow has published the
current commit:

```bash
scripts/check-gate2-public-handoff.py --full-run
```

That mode first preflights the local runtime: canonical public source URL only,
`docker`, Docker Compose v2, `curl`, local Docker daemon, SHA tooling, and free
default ports after removing any previous `beater-stopwatch` Compose project.
Remote `DOCKER_HOST` values and remote Docker contexts fail before clone or
Compose cleanup. It runs `scripts/check-gate2-outside-readiness.py`, performs a
fresh clone from `https://github.com/jadenfix/beater.git`, verifies the clone is on the exact
same commit, reruns the cloned readiness check, and dry-runs the cloned
`scripts/gate2-outside-run.sh` wrapper. The readiness check verifies clean
`main`, the expected GitHub remote, this proof file's structure, and public
multi-arch GHCR images for the exact commit. The verifier then executes the cloned `scripts/gate2-outside-run.sh` wrapper with the clone-start timestamp
captured before the verifier's `git clone`, and cleans up the
`beater-stopwatch` Compose project after the wrapper exits. It proves the exact
public outside-run path and images can run, but it is not outside-person
evidence and does not close this proof file. `--full-run` is intentionally
supported only for the canonical public GitHub/GHCR handoff, not fixture or fork URLs.

If Docker is unavailable on the maintainer machine, run
`scripts/check-gate2-public-handoff.py` without `--full-run`; that still
performs the public clone, exact-commit, wrapper dry-run, proof-structure, and
multi-arch GHCR-image checks, but it is not a runtime handoff proof.

The validator reads the listed stopwatch proof file and screen-recording notes,
then cross-checks default API/OTLP/dashboard endpoints, clean-start status,
browser-proof status, trace IDs, dashboard URLs, SHA-pinned prebuilt GHCR image
references, prebuilt GHCR image digests, and the tested public GitHub origin,
`main` branch, clean-worktree state, and commit SHA. If the proof commit is newer than the tested
SHA, every later change must be under `docs/demos/`. It verifies
screen-recording SHA256 against the committed artifact, requires the artifact to
be a WebM capture of at least 64 KiB with EBML/WebM, Segment, Info, Tracks, and
Cluster structure plus a video track, and requires the recording notes to
describe the full click-through: quickstart trace, `llm.call`, prompt,
completion, model, tokens, cost, latency, and run -> turn -> step -> tool -> MCP
waterfall. Stopwatch, recording, and notes paths must be repo-relative paths
under `docs/demos/` and must not resolve through symlinks.
