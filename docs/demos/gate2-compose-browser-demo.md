- Quickstart trace: `3725033cbe940f1674a9d19ab72d3904`
- All-kind trace: `4849bef9a116057c6f481016b3d604f7`

This run used alternate host ports; the outside-person proof must still use the default dashboard URL `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

The mandate still requires the outside-person run recorded in
`docs/demos/gate2-outside-person-proof.md` before Gate 2 can close.
