This automated maintainer run used the default dashboard URL `http://127.0.0.1:3000`; no alternate host ports were needed.

Regenerate with:

```bash
BEATER_GATE2_WRITE_PROOF=1 BEATER_GATE2_BROWSER_PROOF=1 BEATER_GATE2_RECORD_DEMO=1 scripts/gate2-compose-stopwatch.sh
```

The mandate still requires the outside-person run recorded in
`docs/demos/gate2-outside-person-proof.md` before Gate 2 can close.
