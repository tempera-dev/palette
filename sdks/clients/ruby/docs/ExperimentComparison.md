# BeaterClient::ExperimentComparison

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **adjusted_alpha** | **Float** |  |  |
| **baseline_mean** | **Float** |  |  |
| **candidate_mean** | **Float** |  |  |
| **ci_high** | **Float** |  |  |
| **ci_low** | **Float** |  |  |
| **decision** | [**GateDecision**](GateDecision.md) |  |  |
| **delta** | **Float** |  |  |
| **mde** | **Float** | Minimum detectable effect at the current sample size, in the metric&#39;s own units, at the gate&#39;s (adjusted) alpha and the standard power of 0.8 (§10.3 #5). Populated only when &#x60;decision&#x60; is &#x60;Inconclusive&#x60; — the comparison lacked the power to resolve the regression bound, and regressions smaller than this are invisible at this N. &#x60;None&#x60; on a conclusive decision (or when the paired differences have zero spread, so no effect-scale is defined). This replaces a bare \&quot;underpowered\&quot; flag with the actionable \&quot;how small an effect could we even have seen\&quot; number. | [optional] |
| **p_value** | **Float** | Real two-sided p-value from &#x60;test&#x60;. The previous normal-approximation path reported no p-value at all. |  |
| **required_n** | **Integer** | Number of paired observations that would be required to detect the *observed* effect at the gate&#39;s (adjusted) alpha and power 0.8 (§10.3 #5). Populated only when &#x60;decision&#x60; is &#x60;Inconclusive&#x60; and the observed effect is non-degenerate (non-zero delta over non-zero difference spread). &#x60;None&#x60; otherwise. This answers \&quot;how many more cases would have made this conclusive?\&quot;. | [optional] |
| **sample_size** | **Integer** |  |  |
| **test** | [**StatisticalTest**](StatisticalTest.md) |  |  |
