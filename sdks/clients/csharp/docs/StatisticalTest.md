# Beater.Client.Model.StatisticalTest
The statistical test that produced an [`ExperimentComparison`]. The gate records which method was **actually executed** so a reader can tell a t-test result from an exact McNemar, Wilcoxon, bootstrap, cluster-robust, or anytime-valid sequential one. The old single `PairedNormalApproximation` (a hard-coded-z normal approximation with no p-value) is gone — see `beater-stats`.
