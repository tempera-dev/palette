# Beater

Beater is a Rust-first open-source agent observability, replay, and eval platform.
The target is an OSS self-hostable debugger/evals harness plus a hosted API
product that can compete with Arize Phoenix, Braintrust, LangSmith, Langfuse, and
Judgment-style systems.

The core loop:

```text
instrument agent -> inspect trace -> promote failure to dataset -> run evals
-> compare candidate -> gate CI -> monitor production
```

## Canonical Docs

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md): system design, Rust workspace, storage,
  Vercel split, evaluator lanes, replay, compliance, and milestones.
- [Ship Requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md): requirement-by-requirement checklist for
  what must be true before the platform can be called shipped.

## Clean Clone To Browser

Exact Docker Compose stopwatch proof for the mandate's clean-machine path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jadenfix/beater.git
cd beater
BEATER_GATE2_WRITE_PROOF=1 BEATER_GATE2_BROWSER_PROOF=1 BEATER_GATE2_RECORD_DEMO=1 scripts/gate2-compose-stopwatch.sh
```

The script first removes any previous Compose project/volumes, then runs
`docker compose up`, sends `examples/python/five_line_otel.py` from the
prebuilt stock OpenTelemetry Python runner container, waits until the trace is
visible in `localhost:3000`, and fails if time-to-first-trace exceeds 300
seconds. It also records time-to-quickstart-click when browser proof is
enabled. It leaves the dashboard running by default so a human can click
through the trace.
Before starting Compose it checks Docker and curl. It removes any previous Beater stopwatch project, then checks the required host ports. For
outside-person evidence, free the default `8080`/`4317`/`3000` ports rather than
using alternate ports.
By default it uses `docker-compose.prebuilt.yml` and pulls current GHCR images
published by `.github/workflows/container-images.yml`. The stopwatch script
pins `beaterd`, `dashboard`, `dashboard-e2e`, and `otel-python` to the checked-out commit SHA
tags by default, then records the image references and resolved GHCR digests in
the proof. Set
`BEATER_GATE2_LOCAL_BUILD=1` when you intentionally want to build the server and
dashboard images from source. Set `BEATER_GATE2_REUSE=1` only for local
warm-loop debugging. Set `BEATER_GATE2_BROWSER_PROOF=1` to also run the
prebuilt `dashboard-e2e` Playwright browser proof for both the five-line trace
and the all-kind nested agent waterfall in the same proof run. The five-minute
SLO is enforced for time-to-first-trace and time-to-quickstart-click; all-kind
and recording steps run afterward with per-step timeouts. Set
`BEATER_GATE2_RECORD_DEMO=1` to write `docs/demos/gate2-compose-browser-demo.webm`
and its SHA-pinned notes from the same browser session.

The five-line snippet is intentionally plain OpenTelemetry. To run the exact
manual step after `docker compose up -d --build`, install stock OTEL packages
and execute it against the local OTLP port:

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/beater-otel
/tmp/beater-otel/bin/pip install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:4317 /tmp/beater-otel/bin/python examples/python/five_line_otel.py
sed -n '1,5p' examples/python/five_line_otel.py
```

Fast local proof with built binaries, the all-kind stock Python OpenTelemetry
trace, and the Next dashboard:

```bash
scripts/gate2-proof.sh
```

Containerized self-host proof:

```bash
scripts/smoke-compose.sh
```

The compose topology starts `beaterd`, the dashboard, Postgres, NATS JetStream,
and MinIO; ClickHouse is available with the `clickhouse` profile. The current
`beaterd` runtime still stores local OSS state in SQLite under `--data-dir`.
Postgres, NATS, MinIO, and ClickHouse are present as self-host topology and
schema-contract services, not yet as fully wired Rust runtime backends.

The browser proof should finish by opening:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/?tenant=demo&project=demo&environment=local
```

Run OpenAPI drift detection separately with:

```bash
scripts/check-openapi-drift.sh
```

To regenerate the committed Gate 2 browser capture under `docs/demos/`:

```bash
BEATER_GATE2_RECORD_DEMO=1 scripts/gate2-proof.sh
```

To write the automated compose stopwatch artifact under `docs/demos/`:

```bash
BEATER_GATE2_WRITE_PROOF=1 BEATER_GATE2_BROWSER_PROOF=1 BEATER_GATE2_RECORD_DEMO=1 KEEP_BEATER_COMPOSE=0 scripts/gate2-compose-stopwatch.sh
```

Gate 2 still requires an unaided outside-person run before it can be called
passed. Before handing the repo to the outside runner, a maintainer should run
the readiness check after the `container-images` workflow has published the
current commit:

```bash
scripts/check-gate2-outside-readiness.py
```

That verifies the repo is on clean `main`, `origin` points at this GitHub repo,
the pending/completed outside-proof file is structurally valid, and the
current-SHA `beaterd`, `dashboard`, `dashboard-e2e`, and `otel-python` GHCR
images are public for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

Use [docs/demos/gate2-outside-person-proof.md](docs/demos/gate2-outside-person-proof.md)
as the required evidence template for that run. After the outside runner has
completed the stopwatch command, generate the proof from the stopwatch artifact:

```bash
scripts/generate-gate2-outside-proof.py \
  --runner-name "..." \
  --relationship "..." \
  --prior-exposure "none" \
  --machine-os "..." \
  --browser "..." \
  --preflight-status "passed" \
  --attest-outside-run
```

Then validate it with:

```bash
scripts/validate-gate2-outside-proof.sh
```

The validator checks the outside-person template, stopwatch proof file, and
screen-recording notes from the same run. It rejects alternate ports, warm-loop
reuse, placeholder dashboard URLs, mismatched trace IDs, mismatched commit SHA,
mismatched API/dashboard endpoints, non-main or stale commit evidence,
mismatched SHA-pinned image references, mismatched image digests,
non-repo-relative `docs/demos/` artifacts, and non-prebuilt GHCR image digests.
It rejects recording notes from a different dashboard session and any screen
recording hash that does not match the committed file. The notes must also
describe the full recorded flow: quickstart trace, `llm.call`, prompt,
completion, model, tokens, cost, latency, and run -> turn -> step -> tool ->
MCP waterfall.
The `gate2-proof-contract` GitHub workflow runs the validator template check
and the executable proof-artifact fixture tests on pull requests and `main`.

Warm-loop debugging can skip the pre-run cleanup, but this is not acceptable
evidence for Gate 2:

```bash
BEATER_GATE2_REUSE=1 scripts/gate2-compose-stopwatch.sh
```

Local source builds are measured but are not the SLO path:

```bash
BEATER_GATE2_LOCAL_BUILD=1 scripts/gate2-compose-stopwatch.sh
```

With `beaterd` running in local auth mode, remote smoke can target the live
server and reports `trace_query_lag_ms`:

```bash
cargo run -q -p beaterctl -- smoke --http-url http://127.0.0.1:8080
cargo run -q -p beaterctl -- smoke --http-url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --otlp-grpc-url http://127.0.0.1:4317
```

`beaterd` reads `BEATER_PROVIDER_SECRET_KEY` as a base64 32-byte provider-secret
encryption key when set. Without it, local OSS/dev mode creates
`provider-secrets.key` under the data directory and uses that key to encrypt
`provider-secrets.sqlite`.
