/**
 * Static route smoke manifest for the Beater dashboard (Soundstage, §25).
 *
 * What this file checks (all statically — no server, no build):
 *   1. Every leaf directory under app/ (excluding app/api/) has a page.tsx —
 *      no orphan route folders that create dead URL segments.
 *   2. Every EXPECTED_ROUTES entry (routes confirmed to exist on main) resolves
 *      to a page.tsx at the expected path.
 *   3. PENDING_ROUTES (documented in §25.4 but not yet on main — blocked on
 *      read-API work, §20.2/§20.4) are logged as informational and do NOT fail
 *      the test. When a pending route ships, move it into EXPECTED_ROUTES and
 *      it will automatically be enforced on every subsequent run.
 *
 * Route discrepancies vs §25.4 as of the commit this test was added:
 *   - /settings    → §25.4 says [partial/built] but app/settings/page.tsx is
 *                    absent on main (settings/ is a namespace dir; api-keys page
 *                    lives at /settings/api-keys). Added to PENDING_ROUTES with a
 *                    note so it is promoted when the settings landing page ships.
 *   All other documented-as-planned routes (§25.4) are in PENDING_ROUTES.
